# NeuralNetwork_Scratch
Homework assignments for Artificial Neural Networks course at Chalmers Univeristy of Technology.

## About The Projects

I really enjoyed these first steps into ML & Neural Networks. The assignments are written in python and Matlab. 

### Homework 1

Basics of neural network coded from scratch with python (including Weight-training, error-recognition, stochastich optimization etc)

### Homework 2

Adding more layers to the classic perceptron and also training a network to identify if a problem is linearly seperable or not. 


### Homework 3

First experiments with convolutional and fully connected networks in Matlab.
